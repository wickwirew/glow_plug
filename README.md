# Glow Plug
A simple testing macro `#[glow_plug::test]` for [diesel](https://github.com/diesel-rs/diesel).

A macro that will automatically create a new clean database and apply migrations for each test. Allowing you to actually use a real database for tests without tests interfering with each other or unknowingly depend on each other.

## Example
The connection that is handed to the test is always a clean empty database.
```rust
#[glow_plug::test]
fn test_the_database_is_empty(mut conn: PgConnection) {
    let results = posts
        .filter(published.eq(true))
        .select(Post::as_select())
        .load(conn)
        .expect("Error loading posts");

    assert_eq!(results.len(), 0);
}
```

Also can handle test that return results.
```rust
#[glow_plug::test]
fn test_insert_user(mut conn: PgConnection) -> Result<()> {
    let user = NewUser {
        id: "12345",
        ...
    };

    diesel::insert_into(users)
        .values(user)
        .execute(&mut conn)?;

    let user = users
        .filter(user_account::id.eq("12345"))
        .first::<User>(&mut conn)?;

    assert_eq!(user.id, "12345");
}
```

## Installation
#### 1. Add `glow_plug` as a dev dependency.
```
[dev-dependencies]
glow_plug = "the-version"
```
#### 2. Setup migrations 

Internally it just uses `diesel_migrations` which requires the embeded migrations to be a `const` variable. By default the macro just assumes the migrations are available by using `crate::MIGRATIONS`. So in the root of your project you must declare the `MIGRATIONS`.

These are just reexported from `diesel_migrations` so if you already have the embeded migrations setup you can continue to just use those and remove the `#[cfg(test)]`
```rust
#[cfg(test)]
const MIGRATIONS: glow_plug::EmbeddedMigrations = glow_plug::embed_migrations!();
```
#### 3. Make sure the `DATABASE_URL` in the `.env` file is set.
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
```
#### 4. Run the tests!
```
cargo test
```

## Contributing
PR's are welcome! If people find this useful would love some ideas on how to make this more configurable for other setups since the current setup requires some additional things and the macro just assumes where the `MIGRATIONS` are and that you use `.env`.

## Credits
This is heavily inspired by [sqlx's](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx) `#[sqlx::test]` macro and attempts to bring its usefulness to diesel. So credit to them for the idea!
